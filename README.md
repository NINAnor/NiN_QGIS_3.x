# NiN 2.0 Naturtype Mapping QField Application

This application is based on the NiN_QGIS3.x repository developed by Peter Horvath from the UiO Natural History Museum in Oslo. The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/geco-nhm/NiN_QGIS_3.x).

Instructions on how to use the app and how to create a template specifically for your mapping project can be found in the field surveys chapter from the [Local Ecosystem accounts - a technical guidebook](https://ninanor.github.io/EAguide/data-collection/field-surveys/field-surveys.html).
